# K-means-Clustering
K-Means Clustering using R (Manual Algorithm)<br />
This file has Manual Algorithm for K-Means Clustering.<br />
Here we have to enter data in Matrix and provide initial seeds from support of Data.<br />
Note: Distance matrix is calculated from Manhattan Distance function, however we can change it by introducing new R funtion for desired distance function.<br />
At last we get centroid for final clusters.<br />

###2-Means Clustering: Number of observations=6.<br />
###2-Means Clustering: Number of observations=2000.<br />
###4-Means Clustering: Number of obserations=10.<br />
###3-Means Clustering: Number of obserations=3000.<br />

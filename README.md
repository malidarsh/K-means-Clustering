# K-means-Clustering
K-Means Clustering using R (Manual Algorithm)
This file has Manual Algorithm for K-Means Clustering.
Here we have to enter data in Matrix and provide initial seeds from support of Data.
Note: Distance matrix is calculated from Manhattan Distance function, however we can change it by introducing new R funtion for desired distance function.
At last we get centroid for final clusters.


###2-Means Clustering: Number of observations=6.
###2-Means Clustering: Number of observations=2000.
###4-Means Clustering: Number of obserations=10.
###3-Means Clustering: Number of obserations=3000.
